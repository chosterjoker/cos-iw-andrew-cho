This repo includes the code for my Fall 2025: Independent Work Project.

Use this link to access the dataset that is currently in a .zip file. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bc8UesjjlNnqa8Uxpl4b-Gpru67EsJ7G?usp=sharing

There are three files:
- movies_enriched_big.csv: enriched for use
- movies_enriched_with_semantic.pkl: ##USE THIS FOR *IW_CODE.IPYNB* (SKIPS STEPS FOR YOU)
- ratings.csv

The script *enrich_big_dataset.py* takes MovieLen's 32M dataset and enriches it with additional information resulting in *movies_enriched_big.csv*. The raw movie dataset before enrichment
is available in the link below. The link below is the OG dataset source (MovieLens).
